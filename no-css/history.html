            <h2><strong>1. Milestones of the Web & Browsers</h2></strong>
            <p>Since its founding in 1989, the World Wide Web has touched the lives of billions of people around the world and fundamentally changed how we connect with others, the nature of our work, how we discover and share news and new ideas, in 1990 The World Wide Web(later renamed Nexus) begins as a CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) project called ENQUIRE, initiated by British scientist Tim Berners-Lee.</p>

            <ul>
<li><strong> 1991:</strong>The first edition was completed "some time before" 25 December 1990, according to Berners-Lee, after two months of development.[5] The browser was announced on the newsgroups and became available to the general public in August 1991.
Berners-Lee considered different names for his new application, including The Mine of Information and The Information Mesh, before publicly launching the WorldWideWeb browser in 1991<br><br></li>
<li><strong>1992:</strong><strong>MacWWW,</strong> also known as Samba,is an early minimalist web browser from 1992 meant to run on Macintosh computers. It was the first web browser for the classic Mac OS platform, the first for any non-Unix operating system, and the only browser ever released that supported System 6. MacWWW tried to emulate the design of WorldWideWeb.[5] Unlike modern browsers it opened each link in a new window only after a double-click. </strong>
<br><br></li>
<li><strong>1993:</strong><strong>Mosaic:</strong>with the advent of the Internet in governments, universities and large corporations, Mosaic, the second graphical web browser available for websites, was born. It was created at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and designed by Marc Andreessen. Initially, it only ran on Unix workstations and was developed for the Microsoft Windows system, but it has been considered the first browser with relevance, as the NCSA later developed adaptive versions for both Windows and Macintosh.  
Although not the first web browser t was the first browser to display images inline with text instead of a separate window.
It supported various Internet protocols such as HTTP, FTP, NNTP, and Gopher. Its interface, reliability, personal computer support
<br><br></li>
<li><strong>1994:</strong><strong>Netscape Navigator:</strong>the first commercial web browser created by the company Netscape Communications. It was completely free for all non-commercial users. This development marked the beginning of the competitive struggle between browsers, a struggle marked, above all, by Microsoft and Netscape. In 1997 the company launched Netscape Navigator 2.0, the first browser with Java script language on web pages
<li><strong>Opera:</strong> The Norwegian company Opera Software created this browser in 1994. It has been free to use since the release of version 8.50. It has been recognised for its speed, security and standardisation, and has a constantly evolving international language. It is compatible with Microsoft Windows, Mac OSX and GNU/Linux operating systems, among others.  

</li>
<br><br></li>
<li><strong>1995:</strong><strong>Internet Explorer</strong>(IE) web browser was developed by Microsoft Windows in 1995. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, it became the most popular browser. According to the technology company, it reached usage rates of 95 % between 2002 and 2003. However, its popularity declined over the years, as competitors developed browsers with a renewed aesthetic, such as Google Chrome
<br><br></li>
<li><strong>2001:</strong>Jimmy Wales launches Wikipedia. Users write over 20,000 encyclopedia entries in the first year.

<br><br></li>
<li><strong>2003:</strong><strong>Safari,</strong>browser is installed by default on Apple’s connected devices and was launched on 7 January 2003. According to its developers, it is the most stable and advanced of all, and consumes less battery power than Chrome and Mozilla, its main competitors. It is completely free and has security add-ons that offer private browsing.  

<br><br></li>
<li><strong>2004:</strong>	<strong>Mozilla</strong> was created by Dave Hyatt and Blake Ross as a computer test, and takes Mosaic as its direct ancestor. The first version was released on 9 November 2004. It progressively advanced to become one of the most widely used Internet browsers, with a worldwide usage share of around 30 %, according to official company sources. The browser has been very popular in Germany and Poland, with a usage rate of 60 % and 47 % respectively. 
    <p>Harvard student <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> launches thefacebook.com. 1,200 Harvard students sign up within the first 24 hours. Facebook goes on to become the world’s biggest social networking site, with over a billion users worldwide.</p>
<br><br></li>
<li><strong>2008:</strong> <strong>"the Google Chrome"</strong> web browser, founded by Google, came into existence and started taking over the entire market of web browsers and ruling them. It attracted users all across the globe because of its high-speed rendering, improved web performance and well-designed interface. To date it has maintained its position as the most used web browser.
    <br><br></li>
    <li><strong>2015+:</strong>, Internet Explorer was renamed as <strong>"Microsoft Edge"</strong>. In today’s time, Microsoft Edge comes preinstalled on many Windows devices.
