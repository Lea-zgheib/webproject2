            <h2>Security on the Web/Browser</h2>
            <p>The internet is involved in nearly every aspect of our lives — whether it's for education, professional tasks, shopping, or keeping in contact with friends. However, going online carries certain dangers. Cyber threats such as phishing scams, malware, data breaches, and identity theft are increasingly prevalent and can lead to significant issues, including the loss of personal information and financial harm.</p>

                <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Fake emails, messages, or websites trick users into giving personal information like passwords or credit card numbers.<br><br></li>
                <li><strong>Harmful Programs:</strong>Harmful software that can extract data, slow down devices, or grant hackers access to your computer.

               <br><br> </li>
               <li><strong>File Locking Attacks:</strong>Hackers lock your files and ask for money to unlock them.

             <br><br>  </li>
             <li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong>When hackers break into a company's network and obtain sensitive user information like emails, passwords, or financial records.

             <br><br></li>
             <li><strong> Identity Theft:</strong>Criminals use stolen personal information to open accounts, make purchases, or commit fraud in your name.

            <h2>2-Safe Practices to Protect Yourself</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/protect data.jpg">
            </figure>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Use Strong, Unique Passwords:</strong> Each account should have a different, complex password (mix of letters, numbers, symbols). Use a password manager to keep track of them.<br><br></li>

  <li><strong>Enable Two-Factor (or Multi-Factor):</strong> Adds an extra layer of security — even if the password is stolen, the attacker needs another factor.<br><br></li>

  <li><strong>Keep Software Updated:</strong> Regular updates for operating systems, browsers, and apps patch vulnerabilities. Especially important for widely used programs like web browsers, OSes, and video conferencing tools.<br><br></li>

  <li><strong>Be Wary of Phishing & Suspicious Links:</strong> Don’t click on links or attachments from unknown sources. Check URLs carefully (look for “https://” and the padlock icon).<br><br></li>

  <li><strong>Limit Data Sharing / Privacy Settings:</strong> Only give apps or websites permissions they really need. Use privacy settings on social media and avoid oversharing.<br><br></li>

  <li><strong>Use Secure Connections:</strong> Always use HTTPS sites rather than HTTP. When using public Wi-Fi, use a VPN to encrypt your traffic.<br><br></li>

  <li><strong>Back Up Important Data Regularly:</strong> So if one device is compromised, you don’t lose everything. Use cloud backup or external drives.<br><br></li>

  <li><strong>Use Antivirus / Anti-Malware & Firewalls:</strong> Good protection software helps detect malicious files, and firewalls stop unsolicited traffic.<br><br></li>

  <li><strong>Stay Informed & Educated:</strong> Know the latest threats like new phishing techniques or ransomware. Read about major breaches so you learn from them.<br><br></li>
</ul>
