            <p>Mobile-first design is a web development approach that focuses on creating designs for smaller screens, such as smartphones, before adapting them for larger devices. This strategy guarantees that the essential features and user experience are tailored for mobile users, who represent a substantial share of online traffic.</p>

            <h3>2-Importance of Mobile-First Development</h3>
            <ul>
              <!--Most people use their phones to access the internet nowadays.

Mobile screens are small, so starting with mobile forces designers to focus on the most important content and make navigation simple.

Once the mobile version works well, the design is then expanded or enhanced for tablets and desktop computers (this is called “progressive enhancement”).

In short: Mobile-First Development = designing for small screens first, then scaling up, so your website or app is fast, simple, and easy to use on all devices.-->
                <li><strong>Better User Experience:</strong>Designing with a mobile-first approach ensures that websites are straightforward, uncluttered, and user-friendly, allowing visitors to locate information swiftly.

               <br><br> </li>
               <li><strong>Works for Everyone:</strong>Designs are suitable for touch interaction, easy to read, and accessible to everyone, including individuals with disabilities.

              <br><br> </li>
              <li><strong>Faster Loading:</strong>Optimized images and lighter pages make websites load quickly on mobile and desktop.

              <br><br></li>
              <li><strong>Helps Your Site Rank Higher (SEO):</strong>Google looks at the mobile version first, so mobile-optimized sites are more likely to appear at the top of search results.

              <br><br></li>
              <li><strong>Focus on Important Content:</strong>Shows key information first using headings, short paragraphs, and clear layout.

              <br><br></li>
              <li><strong>Easy to Scale for Other Devices:</strong>Starting with mobile makes it easier to adjust the site for tablets and desktops later.

             <br><br> </li>
             <li><strong>Organized Content:</strong>Mobile-first design forces careful planning of what content is needed, improving clarity and navigation.

             <br><br></li>
             <li><strong>Better for Users and Search Engines:</strong>Optimized images, clear layout, and structured content help both visitors and Google understand your site.
